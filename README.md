## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/kMCt2gH/Recipe-page-challenge.png)

This one's been the challenged I've enjoyed the most so far. It made me use a fair amount of HTML tags to make the page and I've enjoyed making the main grid of the recipe.

### Built With

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:

- [x] User story: I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- [x] User story: I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
- [x] User story: I can see number of servings, baking times
